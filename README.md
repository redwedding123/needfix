This is a simple Netflix-parody frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It recreates the basic look and feel of Netflix with a hero banner, movie rows, hover effects, and a clean responsive layout. This project is meant purely for practice and UI learning—there is no backend, authentication, or real streaming functionality. You can open the index.html file directly in a browser to view the demo.
